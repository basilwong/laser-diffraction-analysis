# Laser Diffraction Analysis

This class is for analyzing the intensity spectrum for a laser going through a single slit aperture. Using this class the intensity spectrum can be compared with the Fraunhofer and Fresnel Diffraction models. 

## Setup

Clone this repository using the terminal command:

```

Add all (python package)dependancies using the terminal command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use Example

```
import diffractiondata

a = DiffractionData()

```

The result of the above code can be viewed as below:
